    <h2>Usage/Problem</h2>
    <p>
        ScrollView is a basic scrolling container that can host a single child view. It can be used to scroll any type of content within it, such as a list of items or a complex layout. However, ScrollView has limitations when it comes to nested scrolling. If you have a ScrollView inside another ScrollView, only the outer ScrollView will scroll, and the inner ScrollView will not respond to touch events.
